# Distance matrix calculation

This program calculates the distance matrix for a given subset of graph vertices.
It accepts the graph as a list of edges and the subset of vertices as a list of vertex IDs.

For more context, see the thesis "Social network analysis in academic environment" on my [GitHub](https://jindrich.bar/master-thesis/bar-social-network-analysis-in-academic-environment-2024.pdf).

## Compilation

On Linux, compile with:

```bash
g++ -pthread -o distance-matrix index.cpp
```
