%% Do not forget to edit abstract.xmpdata.

While university information systems usually have detailed data about courses, publications and lecturers, 
they rarely mine the relationships between these entities to provide additional value to the users.
This thesis aims to improve the Charles Explorer web application by utilizing the synthesized academic social network from the existing relational data.
We propose a pipeline for transforming relational data from the university systems into a graph representation of the academic social network. 
We explore the network and propose various ways to infer missing data using the graph model. 
Later, we benchmark different re-ranking strategies using social network metrics against existing academic search engines and show that social network-based re-ranking can improve search results ranking.
Lastly, we reimplement the tool for visualising the academic social network in the Charles Explorer application for a better user experience.
