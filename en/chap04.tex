\chapter{Social network boosted ranking}

This chapter discovers the reasons for social network analysis from the document retrieval point of view.

\section{Full-text search}

A section discussing the inner workings of a full-text search and the advantages and disadvantages of this in (academic) search tools.

\dots

\section{Re-ranking}

A rather theoretical section about the different ranking methods and reasons for re-ranking. Later on, we propose the actual algorithm for search result re-ranking based on the social network data (and the current search results). 

\dots

\section{Benchmarks}

A section discussing the performance benchmarks for different search result rankings.

\dots

\section{Implementation details, performance}

A section about the implementation details for the social network enhanced search within Charles Explorer. Can contain parts about the actual real-time performance (and discussion whether the added reranking value is worth the potential performance degradation).
