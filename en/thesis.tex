% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{
While university information systems usually have detailed data about courses, publication and lecturers, 
they rarely mine the relationships between these entities to provide additional value to the users.
In this thesis, we aim to improve the Charles Explorer web application by utilizing the synthesized academic social network from the existing relational data.
We propose a pipeline for transforming relational data from the university systems into a graph representation of the academic social network. 
We explore the network and propose various ways of utilizing the graph model for inferring missing data. 
Later, we benchmark different re-ranking strategies using the social network metrics against existing academic search engines and show that the social network-based re-ranking can improve the search results ranking.
Lastly, we reimplement the tool for visualising the academic social network in the Charles Explorer application for better user experience.
