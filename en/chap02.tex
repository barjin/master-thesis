\chapter{Data models and transformations}

This chapter talks about the way the format the data is received in (a relational database) and the differences between a relational and a graph model. In the following sections, we figure out how to effectively transform the relational data into a social network and what additional information does the transformed model tell us about the data (and how to get/calculate the information, again, effectively).

\section{Relational vs. graph model}

A short theoretical section about the differences between the two different data models.

\dots

\section{Transformation}

A section about the details of the relational - graph transformation, the way the graph is stored (and reasons why - with respect to the operations we want to run on the data).

\dots

\section{Analyzing the social network}

The first contact with the network, description of some basic properties, discovering the features of the data and trying to mine some non-obvious relations from the data.
